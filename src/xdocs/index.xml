                Packet Spy is a java library that provides a mechanism for
                network packet capture. The library supports developers who
                wish to write cross platform network packet capture programs.

            <p>
                Packet Spy uses the libpcap library under *nix style systems
                and WinPCap library on Windows systems. Packet Spy also
                provides a basic protocol decosing layer for popular protocols
                such as; Ethernet2 (IEEE 802.3), IPv4, ICMP, IGMP, TCP and UDP.

                Packet Spy was developed as part of the
                <a href="http://hive.cs.latrobe.edu.au/">Hive</a> research
                project. Initially Hive considered using the exisiting
                java packet capture libraries. The existing libraries had
                limitations that prohibitted their use in long running packet
                capture applications. This limitation was acceptable in the
                context of the research Hive was undertaking and as a result
                Packet Spy was developed. No code from the existing libraries
                was incorporated into Packet Spy but many of the ideas and
                approaches can be directly credited to the existing libraries.
