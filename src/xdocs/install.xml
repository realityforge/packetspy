                There is two parts of Packet Spy; the java library and the
                native library. The java library (packetspy-X.X.jar) must be
                placed in the CLASSPATH of the application using Packet Spy.
                The native library (packetspy-X.X.dll under windows or
                libpacketspy-X.X.so under *nix) must be addded to the
                java library path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under *nix platforms such as Linux you need to set the
                environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory
                that the libpacketspy-X.X.so library is included. Assuming that
                packetspy is installed in /usr/local/packetspy-X.X then you
                need to do something like the following;
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/packetspy-X.X
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
]]></source>
            <p>
                Under windows platforms you need to copy the packetspy-X.X.dll
                library to either the windows system directory or preferrably
                into the working directory of the application using Packet Spy.
            </p>

                The user also needs to install the underlying packet capture
                library. Under windows this is WinPCap and under *nix based
                systems this is libpcap. See the <a href="links.html">links</a>
                page for where to download and install the library from.
